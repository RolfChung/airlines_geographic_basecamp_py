# airlines_geographic_basecamp_py

From scientific fields like meteorology and climatology, through to the software on smartphones like Google Maps and Facebook check-ins, geographic data is always present in everyday life.
This projects explores the fundamentals of geographic coordinate systems and how to work with the basemap library to plot geographic data points on maps. The flight data set used is taken from the [openflights website](https://openflights.org/data.html) and used to visualize the data on maps with raw geographic data like latitudes and longitudes.
